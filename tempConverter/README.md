Python 2.7.9

Branch for my Python project to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Started with F_to_C to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Made F_to_C v2 to change the word degrees to the unicode symbol Â°.
Then made F_or_C so that you could either go from Fahrenheit to Celsius or the other way around.
Made F_or_C v2 so that the script would loop back to the beginning. Also to make code more neat.
